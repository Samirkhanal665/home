            Living in Korea as an international student is an incredible blend of academic rigor, cultural immersion, and personal growth. The journey might start with challenges such as learning the Korean language, understanding local customs, and adjusting to a new environment. However, these experiences shape you into a more resilient and adaptable individual.
        </p>
        <h2>Highlights of My Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Academic Growth:</strong> Studying Information Systems and Security at Tongmyong University has exposed me to advanced technologies and methodologies that are highly relevant in today’s digital world. I’ve had opportunities to collaborate with peers from diverse backgrounds, making the learning process even more enriching.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cultural Immersion:</strong> Korea’s culture is fascinating, from its traditional Hanbok clothing to the modern K-pop scene. Celebrating festivals like Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving) and visiting ancient palaces have been some of the most memorable moments.
            </li>

                <strong>Food Adventures:</strong> Korean cuisine is a delightful experience. Trying dishes like bibimbap, kimchi, and Korean barbecue has added a flavorful touch to my life here.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Exploring Korea:</strong> Living in Busan, I’ve explored beautiful beaches like Haeundae, visited cultural landmarks like Gamcheon Culture Village, and enjoyed the vibrant city life.
